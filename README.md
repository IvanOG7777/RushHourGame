Decided to make a rush hour board game in C++ because I was bored.

Instructions:

Use arrows to move around the map,
Press enter to 'pick up' a piece,
Either press Esc to 'drop' the piece back to its original spot, or move the  piece with the arrows and press Enter to place the piece.
Once you solve all maps, press R to restart again or enter/esc to quit
